<h1> Ballet Details in LNB Dance Academy </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>A ballet, a work, consists of the choreography and music for a ballet production.</p>
<p>Ballets are choreographed and performed by trained ballet dancers. </p>
<p>Traditional classical ballets are usually performed with classical music accompaniment and use elaborate</p>
<p>costumes and staging, whereas modern ballets, such as the neoclassical works of American choreographer George Balanchine,<br>
 often are performed in simple costumes (e.g., leotards and tights) and without the use of elaborate sets or scenery.
